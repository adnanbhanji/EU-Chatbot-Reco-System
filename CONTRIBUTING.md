# Contributing to EcoBot (EU Chatbot Reco System)

Welcome to the EcoBot project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. This document outlines guidelines for participating in this project. By joining us, you agree to adhere to these terms.

## Code of Conduct

Please review our Code of Conduct to ensure a respectful and inclusive community.

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and readability, we follow these coding standards:

### Python Conventions

- Adhere to **PEP 8** for Python code style.
- Use **snake_case** for variables and functions, and **CamelCase** for classes.
- Organize your code logically, separating concerns with appropriate spacing and comments.

## Error Handling

- Utilize **try-except** blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

## Security Practices

- Validate data to prevent injections.
- Employ secure methods for handling user data and authentication.

## Commit Guidelines

Effective commit messages are essential for understanding project history. Please follow these guidelines:

- Write **concise, descriptive** commit messages.
- Make small, atomic commits that describe a single change.
- Use present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Follow the branch naming format: `type/description` (e.g., `feature/login-system`, `bugfix/login-error`).

## Documentation Norms

Good documentation is crucial for project success:

### Inline Comments

- Comment on complex logic or areas that may not be immediately obvious.
- Avoid commenting on self-explanatory code.

### README and Other Docs

- The **README** should include sections on Introduction, Setup, Usage, and Contributing.
- Document APIs using tools like **Swagger** and maintain a `/docs` directory for additional documentation.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
