# Model Architecture

## Overview

Our project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models, including GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, alongside a custom-developed bot, to facilitate nuanced interactions and processing tasks. These models enable our system to understand and generate human-like text, analyze data, and provide personalized responses to users in real-time.

## Model Details

### GPT-4

GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, represents the latest evolution in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer series. Within our project, GPT-4 serves as the backbone for natural language understanding and response generation. 

- **Usage**: GPT-4 is primarily used to power the chatbotâ€™s ability to engage in natural, contextually relevant conversations with users. It interprets user queries and generates responses that are both informative and conversational.
- **Customizations**: We've fine-tuned GPT-4 for the use specific to agricultural practices and carbon emission factors to enhance its accuracy and relevance in environmental contexts. This customization ensures the model is well-equipped to handle domain-specific inquiries.

### LLaMA-2

LLaMA-2, a lesser-known but highly efficient model, focusing on specific analytical tasks and data processing within our system.

- **Integration**: LLaMA-2 is integrated to analyze emission data, identifying patterns, and suggesting optimization strategies for users to reduce their carbon footprint.
- **Usage**: It processes structured data submitted through the chatbot, applying machine learning algorithms to provide insights and recommendations based on current agricultural practices and emission levels.

### Custom Bot

The Custom Bot is a proprietary model we developed to ...

- **Functionality**: The Custom Bot handles task-specific dialogues, such as guiding users through the registration and report submission processes. It's designed to manage workflows within the chat interface, prompting users for necessary information and directing their inputs to the appropriate processing channels.
- **Integration**: ...

## Conclusion

Through the three iterations our model architecture combines the broad conversational capabilities of GPT-4, the analytical prowess of LLaMA-2, and the targeted efficiency of the Custom Bot to create a robust, intelligent system. This layered approach ensures our chatbot can handle a wide range of user interactions, from simple FAQs to complex data analysis, making it a versatile tool for environmental reporting and management.
