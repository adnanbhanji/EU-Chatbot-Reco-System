# Glossary

- **ChatGPT**: An advanced language generation model developed by OpenAI, capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on the input it receives. It powers the natural language processing capabilities of the chatbot.

- **Vonage API**: A cloud communication platform that provides messaging, voice, and video services. In the context of this project, it is used to facilitate communication between the WhatsApp Business API and the chatbot, enabling the sending and receiving of WhatsApp messages.

- **WhatsApp Business API**: An API provided by WhatsApp that allows businesses to communicate with their customers in a secure, reliable, and scalable way. It is used by the project to interact with users through WhatsApp.

- **Azure Cloud Services**: A collection of cloud computing services provided by Microsoft, offering solutions for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Azure hosts the backend services and data storage for the chatbot project.

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used to develop the web server that hosts the chatbot's backend logic and APIs.

- **ngrok**: A reverse proxy tool that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a local server. In this project, ngrok is used to expose the Flask application running on a local development environment to the internet, facilitating testing and development.

- **Environment Variables**: Key-value pairs in a computer's environment that are used to configure and control the behavior of various applications. In this project, environment variables store sensitive information like API keys and database connections securely.

- **API Key**: A unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API. It is often used to control access to a restricted set of features and data.

- **Webhook**: A method used by an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. In this project, webhooks are used for receiving real-time notifications of WhatsApp messages.

- **Serverless Functions**: A cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In this project, Azure serverless functions are used to run backend scripts in response to webhooks or HTTP requests without managing server infrastructure.# Glossary
