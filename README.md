# EU-Chatbot-Reco-System

## üåç Project Description

Compliance with EU Commission environmental carbon emission reporting mandates can be a laborious process, prone to human error, and costly in terms of time and resources. This project aims to solve this with a WhatsApp-based chatbot designed to streamline and simplify carbon emission reporting, ensuring compliance with EU Commission reporting standards.

## üîë Key Features & Benefits

- **Dynamic Reporting**: Utilise Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to send and receive text messages via WhatsApp, which auto-populate the carbon emission report with real-time data.
- **Efficiency**: Eliminate manual data entry and reduce reporting time significantly.
- **User-Friendly**: No complex installations or training required; WhatsApp familiarity ensures ease of use.
- **Accuracy & Compliance**: Ensure precise reporting to meet EU Commission requirements, minimising the risk of penalties.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Receive notifications and alerts regarding reporting deadlines and regulatory changes.
- **Cost-Effective**: A cost-efficient alternative to hiring additional personnel or outsourcing reporting.
- **Environmental Impact**: Simplifying reporting contributes to a company's broader sustainability efforts.
